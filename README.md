<h1>Java - OdometerProject</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, we had to simulate the behavior of an odometer with multiple dials, representing distance in tenths of a mile. The concept behind this project was to model an odometer with multiple individual dials, where each dial represented a different digit of the distance traveled. As the car moved, the right-most dial measured tenths of a mile. I was able to successfully create a simulation that emulated this behavior, providing a practical and educational exercise in object-oriented programming and data manipulation.
