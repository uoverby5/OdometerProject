<h1>Java - OdometerProject</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I created behavior that simulated an odometer with multiple dials, representing the distance in tenths of a mile. The challenge involved adding data members to classes, writing methods that utilized loops and decision-making, creating and interacting with objects, and testing expectations about object state and method return values. I also demonstrate how to use UMLs to implement code.
